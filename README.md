Anu Weather App
Anu Weather App is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application built using Python's Tkinter library that allows users to check the current weather conditions of any city. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it along with the local time of the queried city.

Features
Search for weather conditions by city name.
Displays current temperature, weather condition, wind speed, humidity, pressure, and a brief description.
Shows local time for the specified city.
User-friendly interface with image icons.

Before running the application, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

tkinter (usually included with Python)
requests
geopy
timezonefinder
pytz
PIL (Pillow)
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests geopy timezonefinder pytz Pillow
Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the code.

Set up your OpenWeatherMap API Key:

Sign up at OpenWeatherMap to obtain an API key.

Run the application:

Ensure that you have the required image files (search.png, search_icon.png, Logo.png, box.png) in the same directory as the script.
